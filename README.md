# 1 or 2

Welcome to 1 or 2! This is a game where you guess a number between 1 or 2. This is a game me and a friend created at school kinda like heads or tails but with numbers.

There are two modes, singleplayer mode and multiplayer mode. You have to set a goal number before you start to play a match in both singleplayer and multiplayer modes.

In singleplayer mode, you play against a bot where you start a game by selecting a number between 1 or 2 for the bot to guess. If the bot guesses correctly, it gets a point otherwise, you get a point. Then the bot selects a number which you have to guess, and the same point giving system is applied and you get points depending on which number you select. The first person to reach the set goal number wins!

In multiplayer mode, it is the same as singleplayer but you play with a friend. You enter the Player 1 and Player 2 name and then your desired goal number, then the game is basically the same where you take turns figuring out which number your opponent chose.

This is the first project that I had made a custom background! It is a very simple one but I will try to improve in later projects. Hope you like it! :)
